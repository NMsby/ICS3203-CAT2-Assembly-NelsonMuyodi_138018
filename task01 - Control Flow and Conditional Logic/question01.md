**Control Flow and Conditional Logic**  
a. Write a program that:
    i. Prompts for a user input number.
    ii. Uses branching logic to classify the number as "POSITIVE", "NEGATIVE" or "ZERO".
    iii. Use both conditional and unconditional jumps in the program to handle these cases effectively
b. Documentation Requirement: In your comments, explain why you chose specific jump instructions and how each one impacts the program flow.
