**Array Manipulation with Looping and Reversal**  
a. Implement a program that:
    i. Accepts an array of integers (e.g., five values) as input from the user.
    ii. Reverses the array in place.
    iii. Outputs the reversed array.
b. Requirements:
    i. Avoid using additional memory to store the reversed array.
    ii. Use loops to perform the reversal.
c. Documentation Requirement: Comment each step of your reversal process and explain any challenges with handling memory directly.
