**Data Monitoring and Control Using Port-Based Simulation (4 Marks)**
a. Simulate a control program that:
    i. Reads a “sensor value” from a specified memory location or input port (e.g., simulating a water level sensor).
    ii. Based on the input, performs actions such as:
        1. Turning on a “motor” (by setting a bit in a specific memory location).
        2. Triggering an “alarm” if the water level is too high.
        3. Stopping the motor if the water level is moderate.
b. Documentation Requirement: Explain how the program determines which action to take based on the “sensor” input and how memory locations or ports are manipulated to reflect the motor or alarm status.
