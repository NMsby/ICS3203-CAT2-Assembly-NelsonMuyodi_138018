**Modular Program with Subroutines for Factorial Calculation**  
a. Develop a program that:
    i. Computes the factorial of a number received as input.
    ii. Uses a separate subroutine (function-like code block) to perform the calculation.
    iii. Uses the stack to preserve registers, demonstrating an understanding of modular code and register handling.
    iv. Places the final result in a general-purpose register.
b. Documentation Requirement: Document how registers are managed, particularly how values are preserved and restored in the stack.
